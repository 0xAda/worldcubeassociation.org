# Notes on the Regulations

Quick notes for revision.

## To Be Discussed by the WCA Board / WRC

- How official scrambling programs are decided made available.
- When may rounds be added to an event, and what is allowed?
- We need an impartial list of valid citizenships that will stay updated without requiring political decisions by the WCA.
- 9e) At the beginning? Remove this Regulation? Or do we need it for security?
- 11f) Still need a justification from the Board.
- Ask: Can we swtich to double quotes?
- Suspension isn't defined; what are the rights of the board to deal with competitors / community members / incidents?
- A6e) Require the competitor to sign the score sheet before touching the puzzle?
- Any way we can combine the mission and the spirit?
- Time limits: Is the organisation team allowed to put alternate constraints on multi BLD, e.g. 30 min max?
- Competing in a round outside of the regular time frame
  - Systematic exceptions: judges round, accomodtions for event conflicts
  - Special exceptions: competitors leaving early / arriving late (whether their fault or not), individual organisers going at irregular times to facilitate organisation / scheduling

## Things that are probably not important enough to address in the current documents:

### Have a small discussion?

- Rules about pre-registration
- Fair competitor registration fees?
- Pedantic: cumulative time limits... don't include penalties? Either case, how lenient are cumulative time penalties allowed to be, since they're just for making sure the competition runs on time? (goes with changing cutoffs)
- 3c2a2) The WRC should be reporting all major incidents, i.e. "descriptions of the incident, its circumstances, and its resolution". Clarify the distinction for announcements by the Board vs. log entries by the WRC?
- Bathroom breaks for multi BLD: Have those ever been allowed?
- Mandate certain officials to read the full Regulations and Guidelines? (i.e. not just Delegates, but also main organizers)
- Comptitor's ranking for an event is the rank in the final round participated in?
- Entering events late (wanting to join late, missing the first attempt of FMC for some reason, hearing the scrambles are nice...)
- 9f5) DNS in the middle of a round. Let the Delegate handle it?
- Catergorization of Speed solving events vs. special events/formats vs. blindfolded events.
- Emphasize cubing terms *like this* or _like this_?

### Discarded TODO items

- Make "incident" consistent between Constitution and Regulations.
- "The competitor must" vs. "a competitor must" vs. "competitors must" vs. "each / every competitor must" vs. "all competitors must" (same for various officials in place of the competitor)
- There's no consistent place for all he things that are "provided by" the judge / organisation team.
- Specify roles instead of "X must be made to happen", write something active like ."The competitor should submit X cubes"
- How do you record inter-relations between Regulations (e.g. if Mean of 3 is added for BLD)
- Round formats, types, capitalizations (Combined round)
- For each type of round and type of event, define the result used for ranking, and what counts as "better"
- Grammar: ALL OVER THE PLACE: Singular vs. plural
- 9i is out of place.
- Magic strings broken are a puzzle defect, but don't make sense with the usual descriptions

## General Notes


- Remove "(Draft)" from the titles.
- Find some way to make misalignment rulings from 10f clear without images.
- Mention the Guidelines in the Regulations (e.g. with Delegate's tasks)
- Regulations metadata + credits (inc. RFC mention; look a top and bottom of current Regs)
