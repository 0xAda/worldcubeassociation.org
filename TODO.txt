# Notes on the Regulations

Quick notes for revision.

## To Be Discussed by the WCA Board / WRC

- How official scrambling programs are decided made available.
- When may rounds be added to an event, and what is allowed?
- We need an impartial list of valid citizenships that will stay updated without requiring political decisions by the WCA.

## For Website formatting
- Table of contents
- Cross-links for certain terms

## General Notes

- For anything might make a reader think "Why is it phrased like that?", ther should be another Regulation / Guideline, or some note should be made in the style guide to clarify that some particular choice of phrasing was on purpose.
- Consistent bulleting (along with punctuation, e.g. commas and colons at the end of lines)
- Suspension isn't defined; what are the rights of the board to deal with competitors / community members / incidents
- There's no consistent place for all he things that are "provided by" the judge / organization team.
- Specify roles instead of "X must be made to happen" or "The competitor should submit X cubes"
- Single-corner Twists
  - By the scrambler
  - By the competitor, on purpose
  - By the competitor, by accident
- Remove "(Draft)" from the titles.
- Mention the Guidelines in the Regulations (e.g. with Delegate's tasks)
- Find some way to make misalignment rulings from 10f clear without images.
- Competing in a round outside of the regular time frame
  - Systematic exceptions: judges round, accomodtions for event conflicts
  - Special exceptions: competitors leaving early / arriving late (whether their fault or not), individual organisers going at irregular times to facilitate organisation / scheduling
- Bathroom breaks for multi BLD: Have those ever been allowed?
- Mandate certain officials to read the full Regulations and Guidelines? (i.e. not just Delegates, but also main organizers)
- ASCII sanity check regex: [^A-Za-z \.\n\d\-:;\"\+\#\/\,''\(\)\[\]%\?<>=\*]
- How do you record inter-relations between Regulations (e.g. if Mean of 3 is added for BLD)
- Official abbreviations may not match community standards (no "BLD", database used fm and bf)
- wca-constitution has +x flags set.
- Corner twist.
- A6e) Require the competitor to sign the score sheet before touching the puzzle?
- Round formats, types, capitalizations (Combined round)
- Comptitor's ranking for an event is the rank in the final round participated in?
- Rules about pre-registration
- Fair competitor registration fees?
- Entering events late (wanting to join late, missing the first attempt of FMC for some reason, hearing the scrambles are nice...)
- 9f5) DNS in the middle of a round.
- Pendantic: cumulative time limits... don't include penalties? Either case, how lenient are cumulative time penalties allowed to be, since they're just for making sure the competition runs on time?
- Regulations metadata + credits (inc. RFC mention; look a top and bottom of current Regs)

## Guidelines to Add

- SURFACE on top of timer clarification
- 11f) Still need a justification from the Board.

## Things to put in the Style Guide

- Explanation of normativity, using W3C conventions.
- For most formatting questions, see current Regulations: two-space nested indentation, spacing, serial comma, contractions, use of i.e. and e.g., listing examples (in parentheses or bullets), capitalizations, no tabs, parentheses (unnested) but no brackets, conservative levels of nesting, use of comma/semicolon/colon, single quotes (and interaction with punctuation) references to specific Regulations / Guidelines
- Consistent mention of DNF and +2 (imagine someone searching for all rules that may result in a DNF)
- Capitalization of event names and e.g. committees and officials (e.g. Delegate)
- Mention how experience has shown tht we need to cover all contingencies instead of trusting things too much. That said, the delegate can handle most exceptions.
- Spelling of terms like "Competitors Area"
- Do the Guidelines need to be readable independent of the Regulations?
- When searching for words, be careful about alternate spellings (e.g. search "solv" for "solve"/"solving", "apple" for "apply"/"applied", "penalt" for "penalty"/"penalties").

## List of Terms

- (WCA) World Rankings

## Informal vs. formal definitions

- 2 second time penalty ("+2")
- Speed Solving (2 words, consistent with "_____ Solving")

## Consistency of Terminology

### Done

### TODO
- "The competitor must" vs. "a competitor must" vs. "competitors must" vs. "each / every competitor must" vs. "all competitors must" (same for various officials in place of the competitor)

## Consistency of Grammar

- Consistent use of consecutive "and"s/"or"s, with serial comma. (see 9b)
- Consistent examples in parentheses.
- Consistent use of "If x is the case" vs. "Should x be the case" (I think "if" is equally clear, and simpler.)
- Consistent capitalization and full use of "WCA Regulations" - and maybe other terms? Competitors Area?
- ALL OVER THE PLACE: Singular vs. plural
- Each vs. all vs. every
- "allotted"
- Passive/active voice, descriptive vs. prescriptive, past vs. present
- Apposatives (e.g. "at the discretion of...") need commas.
- "retroactively disqualified" and other split infinitives

## Keep it simple, and in line with the past where possible.

- While "If ... in a solve, then ... in said solve." might be more accurate, I think "the" instead of "said" is simpler and just as clear in most cases.
- Sarah had an interesting qualification / elimination round distinction, but I've removed it because 1) it doesn't fit our usual way of talking about things, 2) if there's only one round, there is no elimination, and 3) "elimination" sounds a little negative for the spirit of the WCA.
- Keep it DRY.

## Consistent Formatting

- For each type of round and type of event, define the result used for ranking, and what counts as "better"
- A two-second penalty should be written as "+2" in quotes.
- Every rule in a section is not indented. Every subrule is indented exactly four spaces, no matter how deeply nested. This was a good choice by ClÃ©ment.
- Incidents? Maybe make it a technical term based on the Constitution, and capitalize it?
- Four-space indentation, make sure to spell-check and check for accidental double-spaces ("  ")
- "default" procedures
- Mention of stopwatch in relation to timer regulations
- Book-style capitalization of section titles (Also, consistent colons)
- Capitalizatino of hyphenated words, e.g. "Foot solving" vs. "Foot Solving" at the beginning of a sentence, or "One-Handed" vs. "One-handed"
- Formatting of the articles for the events, e.g. "Scrambling" and "Inspection" headings
- The subject material of a Regulation should be at the front, even if it might be grammatically neater to put it last. (Think: someone will be scanning the first few words of each line.)
- "WCA Delegate", not just "Delegate"
- Regexes:
    - "said" > "the"
    - four spaces and nothing else on a line
    - too much indentation
    - blank spaces at the end of a line
- Formatting of tables and images-
- Emphasize cubing terms *like this* or _like this_?
- double quotes > single quotes

## WCA Constitution

- Any way we can combine the mission and the spirit?
- 3c2a2) The WRC should be reporting all major incidents, i.e. "descriptions of the incident, its circumstances, and its resolution". Clarify the distinction for announcements by the Board vs. log entries by the WRC?
