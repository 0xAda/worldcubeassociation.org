# Notes on the Regulations

Quick notes for revision.

## To Be Discussed by the WCA Board / WRC

- How official scrambling programs are decided made available.
- When may rounds be added to an event, and what is allowed?
- We need an impartial list of valid citizenships that will stay updated without requiring political decisions by the WCA.

## For Website formatting
- Table of contents
- Cross-links for certain terms

## Specific Regulations

- 1c3b) Second sentence to Guidelines
- Make 9b) more DRY.
- 9f12b) Remove "Rubik's Cube:"
- 9i is out of place.
- 7h3) missing "the"
- D1c) needs to not rely on reference to the Regulations.

## General Notes

- For anything might make a reader think "Why is it phrased like that?", ther should be another Regulation / Guideline, or some note should be made in the style guide to clarify that some particular choice of phrasing was on purpose.
- Consistent bulleting (along with punctuation, e.g. commas and colons at the end of lines)
- Suspension isn't defined; what are the rights of the board to deal with competitors / community members / incidents
- There's no consistent place for all he things that are "provided by" the judge / organization team.
- Specify roles instead of "X must be made to happen" or "The competitor should submit X cubes"
- Single-corner Twists
  - By the scrambler
  - By the competitor, on purpose
  - By the competitor, by accident
- Remove "(Draft)" from the titles.
- Mention the Guidelines in the Regulations (e.g. with Delegate's tasks)
- Mark [CLARIFICATION] vs. [EXAMPLE] vs. [RECOMMENDATION]
- Make every Guideline correspond to a Regulation (what about prizes?)
- Find some way to make misalignment rulings from 10f clear without images.
- Competing in a round outside of the regular time frame
  - Systematic exceptions: judges round, accomodtions for event conflicts
  - Special exceptions: competitors leaving early / arriving late (whether their fault or not), individual organisers going at irregular times to facilitate organisation / scheduling
- Bathroom breaks for multi BLD: Have those ever been allowed?
- Mandate certain officials to read the full Regulations and Guidelines? (i.e. not just Delegates, but also main organizers)
- 3a1) is out of order in the Guidelines
- ASCII sanity check regex: [^A-Za-z \.\n\d\-:;\"\+\#\/\,''\(\)\[\]%\?<>=\*]
- How do you rcord inter-relations between Regulations (e.g. if Mean of 3 is added for BLD)
- Official abbreviations may not match community standards (no "BLD", database used fm and bf)

## Guidelines to Add

- 11f) Still need a justification from the Board.

## Things to put in the Style Guide

- Explanation of normativity, using W3C conventions.
- For most formatting questions, see current Regulations: two-space nested indentation, spacing, serial comma, contractions, use of i.e. and e.g., listing examples (in parentheses or bullets), capitalizations, no tabs, parentheses (unnested) but no brackets, conservative levels of nesting, use of comma/semicolon/colon, single quotes (and interaction with punctuation) references to specific Regulations / Guidelines
- Capitalization of event names and e.g. committees and officials (e.g. Delegate)
- Mention how experience has shown tht we need to cover all contingencies instead of trusting things too much. That said, the delegate can handle most exceptions.
- Spelling of terms like "Competitors Area"
- Do the Guidelines need to be readable independent of the Regulations?

## Consistency of Terminology

- A "regulation" vs. a "rule"
- "score" vs. "results" vs. "time"
- event vs. round vs. group (i.e. which one is a judge assigned to?)
- Records vs. results, and recognition (vs. ranking, e.g. WR on site)
- rank vs. ranking vs. position
- registration vs. pre-registration
- eligible vs. permitted vs. allowed
- solve vs. attempt vs. competing (vs. active competitor)
  - Attempt: everything from handing the cube to the scrambler to signing the scoresheet? (Vincent: Use "attempt" whever possible?)
  - Solve: The timed portion of an attempt (note: this definition might be strained for FMC, BLD, or other potential events). (Does this include inspection?)
  - See A6a2 for a place where we need to describe something inbetween: puzzle possibly already scrambled, but solve not begun yet. Also, BLD has inspection/memorization and solving
- scramble vs. scramble sequence
- From the forum: disqualification > DNF? "penalty : disqualification of the solve (DNF)" ? ( http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1022&p=5867#p5867 )
  - Formatting idea:  "Penalty: 2 second time penalty" and "Penalty: disqualification (DNF)"
- competition date?
- "start" vs. "begin"
- stop vs. halt
- score sheet vs. scoresheet vs. scorecard vs. competition sheet. How about something that is more accurate, like "time sheet" or "time card" or "result sheet"? (see "score" vs. "results" vs. "time")
- plural adjectival nouns "Regulations Committee", "results sheet"
- "give" vs. "apply" vs. "assign" a penalty
- listing alternatives (A7b vs. 1b2)
- "writing down" vs. "recording" a result
- "The competitor must" vs. "a competitor must" vs. "competitors must" vs. "each / every competitor must" vs. "all competitors must"
- thereby vs. thus (i.e. "thereby starting the timer")
- Rules about covers
- Stackmat vs. Stackmat timer vs. Stackmat (i.e. the mat)
- "the X" vs. "a X" (e.g. X = blindfold)
- such taht vs. so that
- "apply" a move vs. "make" a move
- consent vs. discretion of the delegate
- stop vs. end vs. completion of the solve / attempt
- Guidelines: Explicitly label each rule with "Clarification" / "Explanation" / etc.
- Speed solving vs. speedsolving

## Consistency of Grammar

- Consistent use of consecutive "and"s/"or"s, with serial comma. (see 9b)
- Consistent examples in parentheses.
- Consistent use of "If x is the case" vs. "Should x be the case" (I think "if" is equally clear, and simpler.)
- Consistent capitalization and full use of "WCA Regulations" - and maybe other terms? Competitors Area?
- ALL OVER THE PLACE: Singular vs. plural
- Each vs. all vs. every
- "allotted"
- Passive/active voice, descriptive vs. prescriptive, past vs. present
- Apposatives (e.g. "at the discretion of...") need commas.

## Keep it simple, and in line with the past where possible.

- While "If ... in a solve, then ... in said solve." might be more accurate, I think "the" instead of "said" is simpler and just as clear in most cases.
- Sarah had an interesting qualification / elimination round distinction, but I've removed it because 1) it doesn't fit our usual way of talking about things, 2) if there's only one round, there is no elimination, and 3) "elimination" sounds a little negative for the spirit of the WCA.
- Keep it DRY.

## Consistent Formatting

- For each type of round and type of event, define the result used for ranking, and what counts as "better"
- Normalize penalties and the Regulations mention them ("disqualification of the attempt", not "solve")
- A two-second penalty should be written as "+2" in quotes.
- Every rule in a section is not indented. Every subrule is indented exactly four spaces, no matter how deeply nested. This was a good choice by ClÃ©ment.
- Incidents? Maybe make it a technical term based on the Constitution, and capitalize it?
- Four-space indentation, make sure to spell-check and check for accidental double-spaces ("  ")
- "default" procedures
- Mention of stopwatch in relation to timer regulations
- Book-style capitalization of section titles (Also, consistent colons)
- Capitalizatino of hyphenated words, e.g. "Foot solving" vs. "Foot Solving" at the beginning of a sentence, or "One-Handed" vs. "One-handed"
- Formatting of the articles for the events, e.g. "Scrambling" and "Inspection" headings
- The subject material of a Regulation should be at the front, even if it might be grammatically neater to put it last. (Think: someone will be scanning the first few words of each line.)
- "WCA Delegate", not just "Delegate"
- Regexes:
    - "said" > "the"
    - four spaces and nothing else on a line
    - too much indentation
    - blank spaces at the end of a line
- Formatting of tables and images-
- Emphasize cubing terms *like this* or _like this_?
- double quotes > single quotes

## WCA Constitution

- Any way we can combine the mission and the spirit?
- 3c2a2) The WRC should be reporting all major incidents, i.e. "descriptions of the incident, its circumstances, and its resolution". Clarify the distinction for announcements by the Board vs. log entries by the WRC?
