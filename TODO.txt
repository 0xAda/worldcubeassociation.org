# Notes on the Regulations

Quick notes for revision.

## To Be Discussed by the WCA Board / WRC

- When may rounds be added to an event, and what is allowed?
- We need an impartial list of valid citizenships that will stay updated without requiring political decisions by the WCA.
- 11f) Still need a justification from the Board.


## General Notes

- Transfer definitions from style guide to Regs / Guidelines?
- Multi BL Dis always recorded to seconds
- Gen 2 or Gen 3 http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=1036
- Stickerless should apply to all puzzles
- Consider adding a note that Article 6 is entirely in the Guidelines.
- H1d: "at one 60"

## For Website formatting
- Table of contents
- Cross-links for certain terms
  - Hyperlinks for RFC, etc.
- Images for misalignments.

## Discuss

- From Vincent: 9f should be 1mm.

## Things that are probably not important enough to address in the current documents:

- Suspension isn't defined; what are the rights of the board to deal with competitors / community members / incidents?
- A6e) Require the competitor to sign the score sheet before touching the puzzle?
- Constitution: Any way we can combine the mission and the spirit?
- Competing in a round outside of the regular time frame
  - Systematic exceptions: judges round, accomodtions for event conflicts
  - Special exceptions: competitors leaving early / arriving late (whether their fault or not), individual organisers going at irregular times to facilitate organisation / scheduling
- 9e) At the beginning? Remove this Regulation? Or do we need it for security?
- The Regulations don't mention pre-registration.
- Do we need to enforce fair competitor registration fees?
- Time limits: Is the organisation team allowed to put alternate constraints on multi BLD, e.g. 30 min max?
- Pedantic: cumulative time limits... don't include penalties? Either case, how lenient are cumulative time penalties allowed to be, since they're just for making sure the competition runs on time? (Related to changing cutoffs)
- 3c2a2) The WRC should be reporting all major incidents, i.e. "descriptions of the incident, its circumstances, and its resolution". Clarify the distinction for announcements by the Board vs. log entries by the WRC?
- Bathroom breaks for multi BLD: Have those ever been allowed?
- Mandate certain officials to read the full Regulations and Guidelines? (i.e. not just Delegates, but also main organizers)
- A comptitor's ranking for an event is the rank in the final round participated in?
- Entering events late (wanting to join late, missing the first attempt of FMC for some reason, hearing the scrambles are nice...)
- 9f5) DNS in the middle of a round. Let the Delegate handle it?
- We've removed the categorization of Speed solving events vs. special events/formats vs. blindfolded events.
- Emphasize cubing terms in the docs *like this* or _like this_?
- Should we change rules about touching the puzzle during repairs (e.g. during OH / feet)?
- Regulations about touching the cube during repairs should be concentrated in a single, well-phrased regulation.
- Recommend a larger first round instead of a qualification round?
- Find some way to make misalignment rulings from 10f clear without images.
- 9i is out of place.
- 10h) shouldn't be needed?
- Make "incident" consistent between Constitution and Regulations.
- Magic strings broken are a puzzle defect, but don't make sense with the usual descriptions
- "Shall" might seem like "should" instead of "required" to non-native speakers, despite the reference to RFC2119.
- Some of the numbering and organization of the Regulations is still a bit wonky, as is the consistency of grammar and tense throughout the document.
- Some thoughts from [url]http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/showthread.php?37471-WCA-Guidelines-2012&p=757148[/url]
  - Is it clear that there is no +2 for FMC?
  - The rule about being available for judging/scrambling is too strongly worded. It needs to be reasonable about when a competitor is able to scramble/judge (e.g.)
&viewfull=1#post757148
  - Magic and Master Magic judging clarifications? (Events are going away in a few months, though.)
  - Multiple logos: at the discretion of the delegate? (Can encompass the raised logo rule.)
  - Maybe a Guideline: What if the intended Delegate can't make it?

### Discarded TODO items

- "The competitor must" vs. "a competitor must" vs. "competitors must" vs. "each / every competitor must" vs. "all competitors must" (same for various officials in place of the competitor)
- There's no consistent place for all he things that are "provided by" the judge / organisation team.
- Specify roles instead of "X must be made to happen", write something active like ."The competitor should submit X cubes"
- How do you record inter-relations between Regulations (e.g. if Mean of 3 is added for BLD)
- Round formats, types, capitalizations (Combined round)
- For each type of round and type of event, define the result used for ranking, and what counts as "better"
- Grammar: ALL OVER THE PLACE: Singular vs. plural
- Remove "considered"
- Check all shalls.
