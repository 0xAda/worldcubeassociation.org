# Notes on the Regulations

Quick notes for revision.

## To Be Discussed by the WCA Board / WRC

- How official scrambling programs are decided made available.
- When may rounds be added to an event, and what is allowed?
- We need an impartial list of valid citizenships that will stay updated without requiring political decisions by the WCA.
- 9e) At the beginning? Remove this Regulation? Or do we need it for security?
- 11f) Still need a justification from the Board.
- Ask: Can we swtich to double quotes?

## For Website formatting
- Table of contents
- Cross-links for certain terms

## Specific Regulations

- 9i is out of place.

## General Notes

- For anything might make a reader think "Why is it phrased like that?", ther should be another Regulation / Guideline, or some note should be made in the style guide to clarify that some particular choice of phrasing was on purpose.
- Consistent bulleting (along with punctuation, e.g. commas and colons at the end of lines)
- Suspension isn't defined; what are the rights of the board to deal with competitors / community members / incidents
- There's no consistent place for all he things that are "provided by" the judge / organization team.
- Specify roles instead of "X must be made to happen" or "The competitor should submit X cubes"
- Single-corner Twists
  - By the scrambler
  - By the competitor, on purpose
  - By the competitor, by accident
- Remove "(Draft)" from the titles.
- Mention the Guidelines in the Regulations (e.g. with Delegate's tasks)
- Find some way to make misalignment rulings from 10f clear without images.
- Competing in a round outside of the regular time frame
  - Systematic exceptions: judges round, accomodtions for event conflicts
  - Special exceptions: competitors leaving early / arriving late (whether their fault or not), individual organisers going at irregular times to facilitate organisation / scheduling
- Bathroom breaks for multi BLD: Have those ever been allowed?
- Mandate certain officials to read the full Regulations and Guidelines? (i.e. not just Delegates, but also main organizers)
- ASCII sanity check regex: [^A-Za-z \.\n\d\-:;\"\+\#\/\,''\(\)\[\]%\?<>=\*]
- How do you record inter-relations between Regulations (e.g. if Mean of 3 is added for BLD)
- Official abbreviations may not match community standards (no "BLD", database used fm and bf)
- Use only dashes in repo file names, remove +x flag from wca-constitution.
- Corner twist.
- A6e) Require the competitor to sign the score sheet before touching the puzzle?
- Round formats, types, capitalizations (Combined round)
- Comptitor's ranking for an event is the rank in the final round participated in?
- Rules about pre-registration
- Fair competitor registration fees?
- Entering events late (wanting to join late, missing the first attempt of FMC for some reason, hearing the scrambles are nice...)
- 9f5) DNS in the middle of a round.
- Pendantic: cumulative time limits... don't include penalties? Either case, how lenient are cumulative time penalties allowed to be, since they're just for making sure the competition runs on time?
- Regulations metadata + credits (inc. RFC mention; look a top and bottom of current Regs)
- Speed solving events vs. special events and formats vs. blindfolded events
- Sub-Regulations without direct parents one level above?
- Exception: keep in the same Regulation or a sub-Regulation?

### TODO
- "The competitor must" vs. "a competitor must" vs. "competitors must" vs. "each / every competitor must" vs. "all competitors must" (same for various officials in place of the competitor)

## Consistency of Grammar

- Consistent capitalization and full use of "WCA Regulations" - and maybe other terms? Competitors Area?
- ALL OVER THE PLACE: Singular vs. plural

## Consistent Formatting

- For each type of round and type of event, define the result used for ranking, and what counts as "better"
- Incidents? Maybe make it a technical term based on the Constitution, and capitalize it?
- "default" procedures
- The subject material of a Regulation should be at the front, even if it might be grammatically neater to put it last. (Think: someone will be scanning the first few words of each line.)
- Emphasize cubing terms *like this* or _like this_?

## WCA Constitution

- Any way we can combine the mission and the spirit?
- 3c2a2) The WRC should be reporting all major incidents, i.e. "descriptions of the incident, its circumstances, and its resolution". Clarify the distinction for announcements by the Board vs. log entries by the WRC?
