The format should be "X + T + Y = F", where X represents the sum of time penalties before/starting the solve, T represents the time displayed on the timer, Y represents a sum of time penalties during/after the solve, and F represents the final result. If X and/or Y is 0, the 0 terms are omitted (e.g. 2 + 17.65 + 2 = 21.65, or 17.65 + 2 = 19.65).</li>
