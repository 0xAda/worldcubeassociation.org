<h2>Important Notes for Delegates</h2>

<ul>
<li>Official competitions must always use the current version of the official scrambler.</li>
<li>Delegates should download TNoodle to run it on a computer. They should not use TNoodle running on a public server (for security reasons).</li>
<li>Delegates must save all scrambles generated for an official competition, and send them with the delegate report (see <a href="./#1c3a">Regulation 1c3a</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Instructions for TNoodle</h2>

<ol>
<li>Run the <em>TNoodle-0.6.jar</em> file on your computer. <br />
It will open the page <a href="http://localhost:8080/scramble">http://localhost:8080/scramble</a> in your browser.</li>
<li>Enter the details for your competition (competition name, number of rounds for each event, details for each round). <br />
If you would like to password protect the file, enter a password.</li>
<li><p>Wait for the loading bar to finish and click the "Scramble!" button that appears. <br />
A <em>.zip</em> file will download in your browser.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: 4x4x4 scrambles <strong>may take a few minutes</strong> to initialize and generate. <br />
If you are generating 4x4x4 scrambles, be patient while the loading bar may appear to be stuck.</p></li>
<li>Also note that TNoodle creates a <em>tnoodle_resources</em> folder with a few MB of files (mostly cached tables) in the same folder it is run. <br />
Keep this folder if want to generate more 4x4x4 scrambles more quickly in the future, but feel free to delete it if you need to reclaim disk space.</li>
</ol>
