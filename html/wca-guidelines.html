<div id="content"><h1><img src="wca_logo.svg" id="logo"> World Cube Association: Competition Guidelines 2013</h1>

<p>The WCA Guidelines supplement the <a href="wca-regulations.html">WCA Regulations</a>. Guidelines are numbered in correspondence with related regulations.</p>

<p>To make the Regulations and Guidelines easier to read we use "he" where the reader should read "she or he".
The use of the words "must", "must not", "should", "should not" and "may" comply with RFC 2119.</p>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mutiple guidelines may correspond to the same Regulation.</li>
<li>Several guidelines were moved from a previous version of the Regulations, with their numbering preserved (and therefore are not numbered corresponding to an existing Regulation). These are marked with [SEPARATE].</li>
<li>For informational reasons, each Guideline is classified using one of the following labels. Note that this should be treated as metadata, not a description of importance.
<ul>
<li>[ADDITION] Additional information to supplement the Regulations.</li>
<li>[CLARIFICATION] Information to address any possible questions about interpretation of the Regulations.</li>
<li>[EXPLANATION] Information that clarifies the intent of Regulations.</li>
<li>[RECOMMENDATION] Something that is not strictly mandatory, but that should be done if possible.</li>
<li>[REMINDER] Information that may be addressed other Regulations/Guideline, but whose relevance is worth reiterating.</li>
</ul></li>
