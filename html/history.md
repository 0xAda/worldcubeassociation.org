## Older versions of the Regulations

Until 2011, the Regulations were maintained by Ron van Bruchem and the WCA Board. Since then, the [WCA Regulations Committee](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact/wrc) is in charge of them.  
For the 2013 release, the Regulations were split into two documents: the Regulations and the Guidelines.

Here are older versions regulations. None of them are official anymore.
