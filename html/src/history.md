# WCA Regulations and Guidelines

## Older Versions of the Regulations

Until 2011, the Regulations were maintained by Ron van Bruchem and the WCA Board. Since then, the [WCA Regulations Committee](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact/wrc) is in charge of them.  
For the 2013 release, the Regulations were split into two documents: the Regulations and the Guidelines.  
Starting with 2013, updates (with lists of changes changes) will be announced on the [WRC Announcements page](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/announcements/).

Here are older versions of the regulations. None of them are official anymore.
