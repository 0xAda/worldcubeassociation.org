# Qualifications for new WRC Members

From the original [WRC proposal](https://github.com/cubing/wrc-proposal/blob/master/WRC%20Proposal.txt#L32):

- 3b1) To be considered for membership in the WRC, candidates should:
  - 3b1a) Commit to taking initiative in developing and upholding the Purpose of the Committee;
  - 3b1b) Have a full understanding of current and past regulations;
  - 3b1c) Be an active and long-standing members of the cubing community;
  - 3b1d) Have extensive competition participation and organization experience;
  - 3b1e) Have a sufficiently strong command of English to maintain the Regulations and communicate clearly with members of the Committee, the Board, and the general WCA community.

(Note: The WRC proposal was never officially adopted, so there are no official criteria. However, this is the best we have for now.)
