# WCA Regulations and Guidelines Process

NOTE: This page is a draft. It may be factually accurate, but please do not treat is as an official source yet.

## Participation

Changes to the Regulations are proposed by the WRC based on community and delegate input, and officially approved by the [WCA Board](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/about). Major changes to the Regulations are traditionally prepared to be made official on January 1 of each year.

You can participate in the following official ways:

- Post in the "WCA Regulations" subforum of the [official WCA forum](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/).
- Participate in existing [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents/issues?state=open) or file a new one if the topic does not exist.
- [Contact](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates) your local Delegate with questions or feedback.
- [Contact](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact) the WRC directly if you would like them to address something important.

As an alternative, you may want to start or join a discussion on the [speedsolving.com forum](http://www.speedsolving.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?34-General-Puzzle-Discussion). Although speedsolving.com is not officially affiliated with the WCA, most international discussions takes place there (with many delegates and WRC members parrticipating), and WRC may look to speedsolving.com discussion as an indicator of community support.


## Development

The Regulations are developed and maintained on a GitHub repository at [github.com/cubing/wca-documents](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents). GitHub contains the following:
