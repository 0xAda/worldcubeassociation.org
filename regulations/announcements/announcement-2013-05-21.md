Starting with the May 21 update, all significant updates to the WCA Regulations and/or Guidelines will be announced by the WRC in a post at [www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/announcements](/regulations/announcements)
Such posts will also be made "sticky" on the main [WCA homepage](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) for a while, so that they are always at the top of the page.

The WRC will try to make sure such changes are only announced and put into effect at the beginning of the week (Monday-Wednesday), so that Delegates and competitors have time to learn of the changes (and respond with any urgent feedback).

Nevertheless, delegates and competitors are always encouraged to check the date listed on the [current English Regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/) before using a saved/printed version as reference for a competition.
