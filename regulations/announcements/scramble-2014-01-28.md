TNoodle 0.8.2 is now available from <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles>

This addresses the following compared to TNoodle 0.8.0:

- 2x2x2 scrambles only use `<R, U, F>` moves again.
- Regenerating scrambles preserves the order of rounds.
- A bug for merging consecutive moves has been fixed. (This does not affect randomness, but redundant turns may look confusing to scramblers at a competition.)

Please remember that official competitions must always use the current version of the official scramble program. This is always available from: <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/>
