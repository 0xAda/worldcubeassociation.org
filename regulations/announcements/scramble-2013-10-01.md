The WRC is changing the official scrambling program from TNoodle 0.7.8 to TNoodle 0.7.12. This addresses two minor issues:

- Remove the reference to slice moves in the FMC sheet. (Slice moves have never been allowed since TNoodle has been official.)
- Document scramble filtering in the readme.

Please remember that official competitions must always use the current version of the official scramble program. This is always available from: <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/>
