    <%= add_answer "How do I obtain a WCA ID and a WCA profile?" do %>
      If you've never competed before, go to a <a href="/results/competitions.php">competition</a>!
      A WCA ID and WCA profile will be created for you when the results from your first
      competition are uploaded.

    <%= add_answer "How can I find a WCA competition?" do %>
      Check out our list of <%= link_to "competitions", "/results/competitions.php" %>!

    <%= add_answer "How can I register for a competition? Who can I refer to if I have problems registering for a competition?" do %>
      Many competitions do registration right here on the WCA website, but some use their
      own systems. You should contact the organizers of the competition you want
      to compete in for more details.

      <div>
        Search for a competition here:
        <input id="competitions_search" class="wca-autocomplete wca-autocomplete-only_one wca-autocomplete-competitions_search"></input>
        <script>
          (function() {
            $('#competitions_search').wcaAutocomplete();
            $('#competitions_search')[0].selectize.on('change', function(competitionId) {
              location.href = "/results/c.php?i=" + competitionId;
            });
          })();

    <%= add_answer "What do I need to know before attending a WCA competition?" do %>

    <%= add_answer "What are the WCA accounts for? What is the difference between WCA accounts and WCA profiles?" do %>
      <p>
        You are assigned a WCA ID when you first participate in a WCA
        sanctioned competition. When the results from that competition are uploaded,
        your WCA profile will be created, with results from every competition you've
        been to.
      </p>

      <p>
        WCA accounts allow you to prove to us who you are. This allows you
        to add a picture to your WCA profile, and (eventually) will
        be required to register for competitions. This will protect you from
        other people pretending to be you.
      </p>

    <%= add_answer "How do I change my profile picture?" do %>

      </p>

        profile picture.
