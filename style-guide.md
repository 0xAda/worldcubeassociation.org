# Style Guide and Comments on the WCA Regulations

This document is meant to clarify some of the implicit conventions adopted in WCA documents.

## General Information

- The documents are formatted in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a plain-text format created by John Gruber. This makes it easy to focus on the raw text (and any changes), so that it is readable on its own and can also be converted into a fancier format (i.e. HTML).
- The documents are written in British English.

## Formatting Conventions

- References to the "(WCA) Regulations" and "(WCA) Guidelines" are capitalized. For example, Regulation 1a) is a regulation in the Regulations. This makes it clear that "Regulations" refers to the body of the WCA Regulations.
- Puzzles names are capitalized. Event formats like "One-Handed Solving" are also capitalized. A puzzle name + event format should omits word "Solving" (e.g. Rubik's Cube: One-Handed). See Regulation 9b for official puzzles and event formats.

### Specific Formatting in Markdown.

- The Regulations should limit itself to standard ASCII, for maximum encoding compatibility. This facilitates safe conversion and parsing.
    - "Degrees" should be spelled out instead of using the degree sign.

### Recommended Word Choices

- "Regulation" or "Guideline" instead of "rule".
- "Result" instead of "score" (except for "score sheet" and "score taker").
- "Ranking" instead of "rank".
- "Permitted" instead of "allowed"
- "Attempt" instead of "solve" (unless specifically referring to the timed portion).
- "Scramble sequence" instead of "scramble".
- "Start" instead of "begin".
- "Stop" instead of "halt" or "finish"
- "Registration" instead of "pre-registration" (unless specifically referring to registration before the day of the competition).
- A judge "[shall] call" instead of "says".
- "Score sheet" (two words) instead of "score card".
- "Apply" (moves or scramble sequence) instead of "perform" or "do".
- "Assign" (a penalty) instead of "apply".
- "Record" a result instead of "write down".
- "Thus" instead of "thereby".
- "Discretion" (of the delegate) instead of "consent".
- "State" (of a puzzle) instead of "position".
- "Allot" (a maximum number of attempts) instead of "give".

- "If X, ..." instead of "Should X be the case, ...".
- "For X, ..." or "during X, ..." instead of "In X, ..."

- "Start" and "stop" (verbs).
- "Beginning" and "end" (nouns).
- "Finish" (verb).
- "Completed" (adjective).

- "All" (collective) instead of "every".
- "Each" (individual).
- "Any" (potential, i.e. in case of applicability).


## Notable Differences between the Regulations and Common Use

- "Speed Solving" is two words, to be consistent with other "_____ Solving" events.
