The official scrambling program is changing from TNoodle 0.7.8 to TNoodle 0.7.10. This addresses two minor issues:

- Remove the reference to slive moves in the FMC sheet. (Slice moves have never been allowed since TNoodle has been official.)
- Document scramble filtering in the readme.

The current scrambling program is always available from <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/>.
