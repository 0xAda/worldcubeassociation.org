In response to feedback after the May 11 update to the Regulations, the WRC is updating the Regulations and Guidelines with the following changes. These changes are about puzzle defects at the end of an attempt:

- Phrasing corrections for [5b5d](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#5b5d) and [5b5++](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#5b5++).
- Simplifications of the examples in [5b5+](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#5b5+) and [5b5++](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/guidelines.html#5b5++).

This change is effective for all official competitions starting May 21, 2013.

These changes should not affect the meaning of the Regulations, but will hopefully help delegates and competitors interpret them better.

The new Regulations are available at <http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/>  
A history of exact changes is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/cubing/wca-documents/commits/official).
